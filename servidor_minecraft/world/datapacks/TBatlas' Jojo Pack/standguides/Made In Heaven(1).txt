==============Background ==============================
=======================================================
	Made In Heaven is the stand of Enrico Pucci. It is the final
form of C-moon, and has mastered he ability to control gravity.
As discussed by Einstein in his General Theory of Relativity,
gravity is not a 'force', but rather a bending of spacetime due
to the mass of objects. This explains the phenomenon of gravitational lensing,
where gravity appears to bend light despite the fact that classically
gravity is a force that may only effect particles with mass. Made In Heaven
uses this influence over gravity to accelerate time.
	This acceleration is only visible for inanimate objects. Living things,
like people, will experience everything around them happening faster, becoming
slow relative to their surroundings. Only pucci is unaffected by this, giving himself
an immense speed advantage over his opponants. 
	Eventually, time accelerates to the point where the universe comes to an end, 
unleashing Made In Heaven's true ability: to create a new universe with rules dictated by Pucci. 
In this universe, everyone knows their fate. To Pucci, this is a perfect world, where all can
live in peace knowing what is to happen to them. But really this just drives the world
into a mass hysteria, so.. maybe not the best idea.

In summary, Made in Heaven can go fast.

===================================================
============= Obtaining ===========================
===================================================
In order to obtain Made In Heaven, you must meet
three requirements while using C-moon:

1) you must find a location that places you at or above
y=319.

2)You must be at experience level 29 (a prime number) or higher

3)It must be during the new moon. During this phase of the moon,
	C-moon will have particle effects surrounding itself to let
	the user know it is time.
	
	If all three of these requirements are met, and there are no
other active Made in Heaven users, C-moon will begin flashing.
At this point, using a Bible will turn C-moon into Made In Heaven,
as well as summon pucci (but don't worry about him he's just there to 
watch).
===================================================
=============Usage=================================
===================================================
Directions on how to obtain Made in Heave are given in the previous
section. After evolving C-moon into Made in Heaven, you will be granted
4 items:

1)Made In HEaven- This miniature version of Made In Heaven is what you use to summon
	your stand. Placing this item in the far right slot of your hotbar 
	will summon Made In Heaven. Placing it into your off-hand (I like to use 'f' to swap them)
	will de-summon your stand.

	Right-clicking this item will allow you to 'silence' your stand. Silencing your stand
	will prevent stand items from being placed back into your inventory after you drop them,
	which can be useful to save inventory space. Additionally, right-clicking your stand item
	while silenced will replace all of your items. Item's for Made In Heaven are not automatically
	replaced every time you drop or otherwise remove them from your inventory, so it is possible
	to simply remove all of Made In Heaven's item's from your inventory while not silenced.

2)Slash / Barrage- This item works similar to other stand's punch/barrage items. 
	Right clicking this item while it is in your mainhand will cause it to punch.
	Made in Heaven's punches will change depending on whether or not time is currently
	accelerated. When time is accelerated, Made in Heaven will leap further in front of the
	player, have afterimages, and have a slightly larger hitbox.

	Placing this item into your off-hand causes Made In Heaven to barrage. Made In Heaven's
	barrage deals high damage relative to other stand's barrages. If time is not accelerated,
	Made in heaven will simply barrage in front of the player. However, if time is acceleraed,
	Made In Heaven will seek out nearby entities and strike them at rapid pace, leaving
	afterimages. This seeking barrage will target mobs in front of you in a relatively broad
	radius.

3)Fly- This ability allows the made in heaven user to fly. Right clicking
	this item will toggle Made In Heaven's user's flight. When in flying mode,
	Holding down shift / crouching will cause the user to fly in the direction
	they are facing. The more time has accelerated, the faster the user
	will fly.

4) Time Acceleration / Universe Reset - This is Made In Heaven's primary ability.
	In order to reset the universe, Made in heaven must first start accelerating time.
	There are several phases to this ability, each with different attributes. In order to advance a phase,
	Right click this item in your main-hand. Placing this item in your off-hand will allow you to return
	to the previous phase / cancel time acceleration. If the made in heaven user dies during any
	stage, effects of time acceleration are removed.
	
	Phase one- In this phase, Made in Heaven's time altering effects are only felt near the user.
		Nearby projectiles are sped up, while nearby mobs and players are slowed down. Additionally,
		Made in Heaven's flight speed is increased substantially, and it's barrage and slash are replaced
		with faster afterimage variants.
	
	Phase two- In this phase, time acceleration becomes global, though it is still felt stronger
		near the made in heaven user. Projectiles now move even faster, and afterimages will appear
		around the made in heaven user. The day/night cycle starts to move faster. This is the best
		stage for other players to try to ki

	Phase three- During this phase, it becomes clear that Made in Heaven's user intends to reset the universe.
		Functionally it is very similar to phase two, however in this stage the MIH user is granted
		resistance, and afterimages will kill hostile mobs. The day/night cycle will move at an increasingly
		greater rate. If a player is killed during phase 3 while the universe is resetting, they will lose
		their stand if the made in heaven user choses to reset the universe. The only way for them to get
		it back is to un-reset the universe, after which they will recieve it back as a stand disc.
		
	Phase four- Universe reset. After a substantial cooldown during phase three, the Made In Heaven user
		gains the ability to create a new universe. The rules of this new universe are detailed in the
		following section. After this ability is used, MIH reverts back to phase 'zero', with no time altering
		abilities active.
===================================================
=============The New Universe======================
===================================================
	The universe Made in Heaven creates is identical to
the previous one, except all humans now know their fate. 
In canon, this knowledge freaks everyone out, but in minecraft
it may be useful to you. 
	Upon entering the new universe, and subsequently after every death,
non-MIH players will recieve a message detailing how they are fated to die.
Your fate may be to get shot, or to be murdered, or to fall to your death.
The only exceptions are that 1) the MIH user may kill you at any time, and
2) GER may use it's Return To Zero ability to change their fate.
	
After respawning/the universe reset, the chances of each player
dieing from their respective fate begin to increase. After about
10 minutes the chances of dieing from your fate are maximized.
	
However, it is important to note that if you are fated to die from
drowning, you will ONLY die from being in the water too long. This means
that you can exploit knowledge of your fate beforehand, fighting mobs with little
no concern of taking real damage. For real life humans, knowledge of our deaths is a 
terrifying prospect. But to minecraft characters, it is an exploitable gameplay
mechanic. Perhaps Pucci was right.

Let's say hypothetically that you don't enjoy dieing every 10 minutes. 
There are three ways to un-reset the universe:

1) kill the Made in Heaven user

2) Have the made in Heaven user store their stand
	
3) Disc Made in Heaven with Whitesnake

When the universe is un-reset, everything goes back to normal. It is up
to you whether or not this new reality is better than the previous.

That's all, hope you enjoy the datapack. 
Give it a diamond and all that, and have a good day ;).
