Mandom is the stand of Ringo Roadagain, a minor antagonist
and agent of Funny Valentine in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Part 7: Steel Ball Run. 

Mandom has one simple ability: to rewind time near himself
6 seconds into the pst. Ringo, an accomplished and
skilled deulist, uses this ability to bring out the
best in his opponants before ultimately defeating them.

There are several youtube tutorials on how to install
datapacks, but all you have to do is place the above
file into the "datapack" folder located within your
world. Upon creating a new world,
you can click the "datapack" button. Then,
click "add datapacks" and drag and drop this datapack
into the folder opened by that option.

Additionally, you need to install the resourcepack.
This resourcepack is located on the Planetminecraft
page for this datapack. The download link for the resourcepack
is located directly below the download button for the datapack.
To install a resourcepack, all you have to do is put the 
resourcepack file into the resourcepack file located at
"/%appdata%/roaming/.minecraft/resourcepacks".

There are two methods to unlock mandom:

1)obtain a stand arrow by craftin a nether star or netherite
	ingot together with a spectral arrow to obtain a 
	stand arrow.

2)stumble across a devil's palm and obtain a piece of
	the holy corpse.

Afterwards, you must throw the stand arrow/corpse part onto the ground,
and then throw a piece of leather on top. Doing so will
grant the nearest player "Mandom".

You will be rewarded with two items:

1)a Mandom item
2)A fancy revolver

####Note: The game will give you these items back if you die.

Revolver: Mandom's user gets a special revolver that is
	much more powerful than those craftable by other players.
	To use this revolver, the user must first load it with
	bullets. You can craft bullets by surrounding gunpowder
	with 8 iron nuggets in a crafting table. 

	Right clicking will fire a single bullet. These
	bullets will go a long distance, and do substantial
	damage upon landing, as well as a small amount of
	splash damage to nearby mobs.

	If the user crouches, they will fire a quicker shot
	that goes in a straight line, does more damage, but
	has a limited range.

	Normal revolvers also have a damage buff when used
	by mandom's user, so there's that as well!


Mandom: Summoning this stand works differently than others
	in this pack, as it is a stand worn by it's user
	rather than a separate entity. Placing this item
	into your off-hand will Summon Mandom, and allow
	you to access it's ability. 

	When used in the user's main hand, mandom will
	cycle through 3 modes:
		1)Terrain Rewind enabled, which allows time rewind to rewind terrain
		2)Terrain Rewind disabled, disables terrain rewinding, which is less laggy
		3)silenced, which prevents the stand from using abilities and clears up inventory space.

	While summoned, time rewind can be accessed. Right-clicking with
	your main hand open will select the moment to rewind to. Afterwards,
	the user can choose to rewind earlier by clicking again. Or, they
	can wait the full 10 seconds (I gave u guys extra time ;) ) and cancel
	the ability. Time rewind has almost no cooldown, so it is a very easy
	ability to spam.

	Time rewind is exactly what it sounds like: returning to the original
	time. The effects of this include:
		>returning entities to their original locations
		>returning entities to their original health
		>returning surrounding terrain to it's previous state
		>returning player's inventories to how they were

	and many more. It goes pretty in depth. The one thing
	Mandom will NOT reverse is Death, which means that the user
	may use it to re-run a scenario with some combatant until they
	get the upper hand. The only things it cannot rewind are
	GER and Tusk act 4's projectiles.

Overall, Mandom is a simple stand with many combat uses.

um I think that's it? Yeah. Enjoy it!
