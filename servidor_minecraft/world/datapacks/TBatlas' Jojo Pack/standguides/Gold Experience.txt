============Introduction============================
====================================================
Gold Experience is the stand of Giorno Giovanna,
protagonist of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure Part 5:Vento Aureo.
A stand is the manifestation of a persons fighting spirit, which 
will manifest as some entity outside of the user, and have
some ability. Gold Experience has the ability to 'create life',
granting life to inanimate objects. There are a couple rules
to this ability:
1)GE creates life using it's hands
2)The life created will reflect damage taken
3)Giorno can use this ability to heal himself and others
	by creating new body parts.

Although versatile enough in its own merit, Gold Experience
gains a new, almost unstoppable ability after being pierced by
the requiem arrow, transforming into Gold Experience Requiem.
Gold Experience Requiem's ability is simply to undo anything
it wants. Known as 'Return to Zero', this ability
has almost no limits, and makes GER a nigh unstoppable being.
It can unshoot a bullet, undo another stand's ability, and
even undo someone's death, causing them to be stuck in an
infinite loop of death unless the user chooses otherwise.

==============================================
To unlock Gold Experience, you first need a stand arrow.
To 'craft' a stand arrow, throw a Nether star on
the ground with a spectral arrow. The nearest player will
then recieve a 'stand arrow'. 

Afterwards, you must throw the stand arrow onto the ground,
and then throw a gold ingot onto that. You will then
unlock Gold Experience forever, and recieve 3 items:
1)a miniature GE
2)A fist labeled "muda"
3)A rose labeled "life Create"

####Note: The game will give you these items back if you
	drop them or Die.

Mini GE: This item is used to summon your stand. Simply
	Place it into your 9th inventory slot (the furthest
	slot to the right on your hotbar) to summon GE.
	To De-summon GE, place this item into your off-hand.

Muda: This item controls all of the punch attacks of GE.
	If you click with this item, GE will go in front of
	you and punch once, giving your opponent slowness
	as well as damaging them. 

	Putting this item into your off hand will cause GE 
	to do a barrage, constantly damaging your opponent,
	but without giving the slowness effect (unless you
	have Gold Experience Requiem, in which case the
	barrage WILL apply the slowness effect).

Life Create: This item is GE's main ability. It is used
	by right clicking with the item in hand. It works in
	two ways:
	1)If it hits a mob (including the player), it will
	give them regeneration for a short period of time.
	GE will turn around and hit the user with this ability
	if it does not hit a mob or block in a given amount
	of time.

	2)If this ability hits a block, or a special entity
	such as a fireball or lit tnt, it will turn that
	entity into a 'lifeform'. The lifeform created by this
	ability is dependant on which block GE hits.
	For example, if GE hits a dirt block, it will turn
	the dirt block into a pig. If it hits stone, it
	will turn it into a bat. All mobs created by GE
	will have a thorns effect and regeneration, which
	causes them to be hard to kill while reflecting
	damage. 

	To undo this ability, simply place the "life create"
	item into your off-hand. This will cause all life created
	to turn back into its original form.

======Gold Experience Requiem=================
==============================================
In order to unlock Gold Experience Requiem (GER), you need
to create another stand arrow. Then, you must throw
this stand arrow at GE , or otherwise have it come into contact with
GE. An easy way to do this is by using the life-create ability,
or barraging. 

GER has a couple of unique properties outside of gaining
a new item. First, you will have passive resistance as well as
fire resistance. Second, all negative potion effects will automatically
be cleared from you. Thirdly, your stand barrage will now do
twice as much damage, as well as apply the slowness effect GE
basic punches did. GER has all the same abilities as GE,
as well as one new- very powerful- one.

Return To Zero: This item is very powerful, and works on a 
	two-stage trigger which is activated by clicking.

	The first time you use this item, it will create a 
	"zero point" for mobs that are within a medium-sized
	radius around you. The text "Return To Zero Ready"
	will appear right above your hotbar as well, letting you
	know that the second stage of RTZ is ready. Additionally,
	a tiny green particle will be displayed on top of any mob
	that was hit by RTZ's first stage.

	Upon clicking RTZ again, a voiceline will play and
	all mobs originally hit by RTZ will be teleported back
	to their "zero" point, as well as inflicted with a
	glowing and weakness effect. Once 'returned to zero,'
	these mobs will be held there for 10 seconds. Also,
	any projectiles thrown at the GER user during RTZ will be
	deleted immediately upon getting within 5 blocks of them.
	RTZ itself does not do any damage, but it does give the 
	GER user plenty of time to do enough damage to kill anyone.

	The final quirk of RTZ is that any player who is killed while under
	the influence of RTZ will begin to experience an 'infinite death loop'.
	This loop manifests itself by setting the affected player's max health
	to 1 half heart, by setting their gamemode to adventure, by giving
	that player slowness and also by constantly summoning threats to that 
	player nearby, such as lightning or zombies. This player will not 
	be able to exit their infinite death loop until the GER user places
	the 'return to zero' item into their off-hand.

=================special cases in life create===============
=============================================================
Life create will turn certain blocks into certain mobs. Not every
block in the game is accounted for, but I'd encourage you to test the ability
out on a bunch of them. This list is meant to cover the special cases
of when an entity can be effected by Life create, as well as some special
blocks that I'm sure you want to know about.

lit tnt- Turns into a bat. Upon undoing life create, they will immediately explode
tnt minecart- same as lit tnt, but instead turns into a cat. This can be
	used to set traps
arrow- turns into a chicken. upon turning back into an arrow, it will shoot straight upwards.
fireball+dragon fireball- turns into a chicken. Upon turning back into a normal fireball,
	it can be hit back at the dragon or ghast that fired it at you.

wheat,potatoes, and beetroot- will immediately grow these crops to full.

dragon egg-creates an ender dragon
beacon-creates a wither
mob heads-creates whichever mob they belong to (except the player head lol)
wool- creates a sheep with the same kind of wool

Stone item - turns into a beam that fires at the nearest mob/player, poisoning
	them and summoning a cave spider.

============plans===============
================================
My main plans for the future are to
keep adding support for more and more blocks.
I don't know which stands I'll be making in the future,
but I will make sure that the textures for all of them
are compatible. So, if you want to use the tusk datapack
and this datapack in the same world, you can. 

Don't have much else to say. Hope you enjoy the datapack,
and if you do, make sure to leave a diamond or a like
on the youtube video. 

Have good day :).
