====================================================
Crazy Diamond is the stand of Josuke Higashikata, protagonist
of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable.
Crazy Diamond is a large close-ranged stand with hysical power that
rivals even that of Star Platinum.

Crazy Diamond's one and only ability
is to restore objects and people to a previous state.
This ability is usually used to heal injured allies or
repair broken terrain, but can also be used to uncook
spaghetti (It happened).
====================================================
============Installation============================
====================================================
The file above this ReadMe is the datapack itself.
There are several youtube tutorials on how to install
datapacks, but all you have to do is place the above
file into the "datapack" folder located within your
world. Upon creating a new world,
you can click the "datapack" button. Then,
click "add datapacks" and drag and drop this datapack
into the folder opened by that option.

Additionally, you need to install the resourcepack.
This resourcepack is located on the Planetminecraft
page for this datapack. The download link for the resourcepack
is located directly below the download button for the datapack.
To install a resourcepack, all you have to do is put the 
resourcepack file into the resourcepack file located at
"/%appdata%/roaming/.minecraft/resourcepacks".

==============================================
To unlock Crazy Diamond(CD), you first need a stand arrow.
To 'craft' a stand arrow, throw a Nether star or Netherite Ingot on
the ground with a spectral arrow. The nearest player will
then recieve a 'stand arrow'. 

Afterwards, you must throw the stand arrow onto the ground,
and then throw a diamond onto that. You will then
unlock Crazy Diamond forever, and recieve 3 items:

1)a miniature Crazy Diamond
2)A fist labeled "Punch / Barrage"
3)An Item labeled "Toggle Restoration Mode"

####Note: The game will give you these items back if you die.

Mini CD: This item is used to summon your stand. Simply
	Place it into your 9th inventory slot (the furthest
	slot to the right on your hotbar) to summon CD.
	To De-summon CD, place this item into your off-hand.

	Clicking this item will toggle whether or not the stand
	is 'silenced'. Silenced stands will not have their
	inventories constantly replenished. If you do
	not plan on using your stand and need inventory space,
	then silencing is a good idea.

Punch / Barrage: Right clicking this item in your mainhand will
	cause Crazy Diamond to move in front of you and throw
	a powerful punch. This punch does a lot of damage, and
	knocks hostile mobs back. 

	If this item is placed into the user's off-hand,
	Crazy Diamond will move in front of the user and 
	release a barrage of punches. This can be
	held indefinetly, and will deal less knockback
	than the strong punch.

Toggle Restoration Mode: This item has a lot of uses, and will
	change the way Punching impacts the environment.

	Right clicking with this item in your main hand will
	toggle 'restoration mode'. When this is active,
	Crazy Diamond will be surrounded by yellow particles.
	While in restoration mode, Crazy diamond will HEAL
	targets it hits instead of damaging them. Unfortunately,
	the user cannot heal themselves. 

	Restoration mode can be used to cure zombie villagers,
	zombified piglins, turn skeleton and zombie horses into
	normal horses, un-strip logs, turn cobblestone into stone,
	fix cracked stone bricks, defuse tnt and creepers, fix anvils,
	un-oxidize copper blocks, and repair lingering potions that 
	have already been thrown onto the ground.

	Right clicking while this item is in your off-hand
	will toggle whether Crazy Diamond damages terrain objects
	or not. If terrain damage is on, you will notice white particles
	appear when you hold the "Punch / barrage" item. These particles
	indicate the exact block Crazy diamond will destroy if it 
	were to punch. While barraging, Crazy Diamond hits up to
	4 blocks around the particles. Blocks hit will
	become mobile 'debris', which is discussed
	in the next section. 

	Note:Blocks that usually get restored will NOT be fixed if
		terrain damage is on, and will simply be
		turned to debris.

================================
============Debris===============
================================
Debris are blocks that have been knocked away by Crazy Diamond.
Debris objects are mobile, and can be knocked around by
Crazy Diamond's strong punch. Hitting debris into mobs will
damage them, but Debris will not deal damage if it is
sitting still.

If Crazy Diamond enters restoration mode, Debris within a 
30-meter radius will be sent back to it's original position.
Mobs too close to the restored debris will take a small amount
of damage.



um I think that's it? Yeah. Enjoy it!
