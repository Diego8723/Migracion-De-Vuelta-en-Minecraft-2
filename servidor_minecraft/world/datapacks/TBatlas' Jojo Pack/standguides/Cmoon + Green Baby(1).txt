==============Background ==============================
=======================================================
	C-moon is the stand of Enrico Pucci. It is comprised
of a fusion between his original stand, Whitesnake, and the
'Green Baby' (this is the 'Bizarre' part). C-moon's 
abilities revolver around 'Gravity' and 'Inversion'. Primarily, 
C-moon is able to make itself a reverse center-of-gravity, 
repelling attackers away.
	Additionally, due to it's inverting properties, C-moon's
attacks are extremely powerful, able to end battles with
only a single blow by inverting an opponant's body.



===================================================
=============Obtaining VIA Green Baby==============
===================================================
In order to obtain C-moon, you must first have Whitesnake.
Then, you must obtain the "green baby". The process to
obtain the baby is as follows:

step 1: Collected 36 hostile mobs('sinners') in a
	small area (30-block radius). It is useful
	to disc them in order to keep them still.

	I'd recommend someplace outside, or shaded,
	as the process has the potential to destroy blocks.


step 2: Summon pucci over. If you have collected
	enough mobs, then pucci will begin the process.

step 3: after waiting for a couple seconds, search
	the trees that appear for the green baby. It
	will appear in one of their trunks.

step 4: approach pucci as a whitesnake user with
	the green baby in hand. After a conversation,
	he will grant you the ability to ascend your
	stand into C-moon by right-clicking the baby.

===================================================
Directions on how to Obtain C-moon are given in the previous
section. After evolving Whitesnake into C-moon, you will be granted
4 items:

1)C-moon- This miniature version of C-moon is what you use to summon
	your stand. Placing this item in the far right slot of your hotbar 
	will summon C-moon. Placing it into your off-hand (I like to use 'f' to swap them)
	will de-summon your stand.

	Right-clicking this item will allow you to 'silence' your stand. Silencing your stand
	will prevent stand items from being placed back into your inventory after you drop them,
	which can be useful to save inventory space. Additionally, right-clicking your stand item
	while silenced will replace all of your items. Item's for C-moon are not automatically
	replaced every time you drop or otherwise remove them from your inventory, so it is possible
	to simply remove all of C-moon's item's from your inventory while not silenced.

2)Punch / Barrage- This item works similar to other stand's punch/barrage items. 
	Right clicking this item while it is in your mainhand will cause it to punch.
	Cmoon's punches are powerful, and have a special ability where they 'invert' the 
	target if it is a player, crippling them and causing their max health to decrease.
	Punching an inverted player will un-invert them, but a two-hit combo with this
	attack can be lethal. For mobs, this attack deals substantial knockback.

	Placing this item into your off-hand causes C-moon to barrage. C-moon's
	barrage deals high damage relative to other stand's barrages, and may
	be used remotely. C-moon's strong punch also can be used remotely

3)Remote control- Holding right click with this item in your main-hand will cause Whitesnake
	to fly in the direction you are facing. Shift-right clicking with this item will
	cause C-moon to move opposite the direction the user is facing.

	Placing this item in your off-hand will return C-moon back to you. If C-moon goes too
	far, it will automatically return.

4) Gravity Manipulation- This item is C-moon's most powerful ability in
	terms of battlefield manipulation. It has 3 functions:

	a) Right-clicking this item in your main-hand will toggle C-moon's
		repelling ability. Mobs within a wide range will be repelled
		from C-moon, and any players who get close will also be pushed
		back. This effect is stronger the closer entities get to C-moon.
		Only the user, non-living objects, and GER are immune to this effect.

	b) Shift-right clicking this item will enable low-gravity
		movement to the C-moon user. This allows them to jump
		high and fall slowly, mitigating any fall damage.

	c) Right clicking this item while it is in your off-hand allows
		the user to select mobs to be excluded from C-moon's
		gravity. You can use this to prevent dogs, livestock,
		or anything you don't want to get sent away from being launched.
		
		Using this item on a mob that has already been excluded will cause
		them to be un-excluded, and once again effected by C-moon's repelling
		ability.


That's all, hope you enjoy the datapack. 
Give it a diamond and all that, and have a good day ;).
