Overview and background information
--------------------------------------------
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, or 'D4C', is the
stand of the President of the United States,
Funny Valentine. D4C's ability is to access
parrallel dimensions. He uses this ability to
summon clones of himself, who all work in concort
to pursue Valentine's ultimate goal of collecting
the holy corpse, which consists of 13 pieces
spread across America.

Eventually, all pieces are collected. They take
a girl named Lucy Steel as their host, giving her
the stand "ticket to ride", which grants Valentine
the ability "Love Train".

	Revolver guide
-----------------------------------------------
An important part of this datapack is a new revolver
item. You know, like what cowboys have. This gun
is a pretty neat weapon, and is mostly useful against
groups of mobs due to it's small amount of splash damage.

Revolver's can be crafted using a crafting table. The
crafting recipe looks as follows:
	0 0 0
	i i i
	0 t l
i=iron
t=tripwire hook
l=leather

You must then stand on top of the dropper in
order to recieve the revolver. 

Once crafted, your revolver will come free
with 6 bullets. Revolvers may be shot in either
your main hand or off-hand, however you cannot
fire two revolvers at once (sorry :( ).

After exhausting your 6 rounds, you will require
more bullets. In order to craft bullets, you require
iron nuggets and gunpowder. Then, you can craft
bullets by dropping gunpowder and iron nuggets on the ground,
however this will only work if specific amounts of
each are dropped.

1 gunpowder + 8 iron nuggets = 8 bullets
8 gunpowder + 64 iron nuggets = 64 bullets

If done correctly, you will recieve these items directly into your inventory.
In order to reload, place bullets into your off-hand, and right click with
the empty revolver. The max amount of ammo you may reload into the revolver
is 6, however you may also puts 5,4,3,2, or even 1 singular bullet into
your revolver at a time, too.

You may also craft bullets in a crafting table
by surrounding a piece of gunpowder with iron nuggets.

Revolver bullets do a little bit of damage, and can be fired rapidly.
Additionally, revolver bullets can destroy blocks, and shrapnel 
from the bullets does a little bit of splash damage. 

Revolvers are important, as they are a crucial item for clones,
and also have special properties when used with love train.

-----------------------------------------------
	Usage and abilities guide
-----------------------------------------------
Obtaining:

To obtain D4C, you must first craft a stand arrow.
Crafting a stand arrow is as simple as dropping a 
Nether star and a spectral arrow on the ground.

After obtaining the stand arrow, drop the stand arrow
on the ground, then drop a single diamond. If done
correctly, you will recieve a D 4 C item, as well as
2 ability items.

D4C's 3rd ability "Love Train" is obtained after
collecting 2 corpse parts from Devil's palms,
which will spawn periodically around the world.


Abilities Guide:

summoning:
In order to use your abilities, you must first summon your stand.
To summon D4c, you must place the "D 4 C" item into your
9th inventory slot (furthest right on your hotbar). To de-summon
D4c, place this item into your off-hand. You can still summon
D4c even when your stand is "silenced".

To 'silence' D4C, click on the D4c Item. This will
stop you from recieving D4c related items after you drop them, 
with the exception of the D4C item itself. This frees up Inventory
space when D4c is not in use.

======================================================
=================Abilities:===========================
======================================================
Passive:Stand armor. 
	When below 3 hearts, D4C will appear missing some
	of it's armor. This ability doesn't have any function,
	but is still neat I think.


Chop / Barrage: This item has 2 uses. When clicked in your main-hand,
	D4C will move in front of the user before advancing forwards
	for a short period, then choppping. During the period where
	D4C is advancing, you may click again to cause it to chop
	before reaching the maximum range. This can be difficult,
	as Minecraft thinks you are trying to interact with your stand.
	Turning slightly such that your cursor is not over D4C will allow
	you to avoid this. Additionally, clicking twice will cause D4C to
	immediately chop. Chopped mobs will be knocked back. It is best
	to aim for a mob's feet with this attack.

	Placing this item into your off-hand will cause D4C to stand
	in front of you and barrage. This barrage is slow, but does
	decent damage, and deflects projectiles. It is particularly
	useful when Love Train is active, as the knockback from
	Love Train's wall places hostile mobs right in D4C's barrage
	range, and you won't accidentally click Love Train's walls
	instead of the Chop item.
===============================================================
Clones: This item has several functions depending on which
	hand the item is in and whether or not you are crouching.
	I'll summarize quickly here:
	
	mainhand- summon clone
	mainhand+crouching- become clone
	offhand-select target for clones
	offhand+crouching-un-select target for clones

Summoning Clones:
	This ability summons clones. For this ability, the cooldown
	is dependant on how many clones you already have summoned
	in loaded chunks. This prevents you from spamming clones,
	while allowing you to summon enough if far away from home
	in a combat situation. Clones are initially summoned
	in a following state, and will follow you around.
	to make a clone stand in place, right click their feet.
	Clones that are made to hold their position will have particles
	appear above their heads when holding the Clone Item.
	More information on clone professions will be provided in the
	dedicated clones section.

Becoming a Clone:
	Crouching while holding the clone item in your mainhand 
	will create particles ~10 blocks in front of you in
	the direction you are looking. The nearest clone to this
	selector will begin to glow, indicating which clone you
	have selected to swap. Clicking this item while crouching
	will cause you to swap positions with the selected clone.
	
	Additionally, the health of the summoned clone will become 
	your max health, and you will gain their profession.
	You can use this property to heal by swapping with a 
	new clone after taking damage, and the profession
	property to move a clone to a specific spot where
	it's profession will be helpful (I.E., to move a farmer
	clone on to a hopper in the middle of a field).

	If you are being barraged by Tusk, then this ability will
	cause tusk to barrage the clone you swapped with instead of
	yourself. In this manner it can be used to escape Tusk's
	barrage, however the infinite rotation cannot be avoided.

	This ability has a very short cooldown, so feel free to abuse it.

Select Target: Clones that are given a revolver will
	automatically target certain hostile mobs. However, you may
	sometimes want your clones to target a specific mob or player.
	Placing the clone item into your offhand will allow you to 
	mark a player to be automatically targeted by clones as indicated
	by angry particles. After targeting a mob, fire particles will
	appear above the targeted player's head whilst this item is
	in your offhand.

De-select target: crouching while holding this item in your off-hand
	will do the opposite of the Select target function. Green
	particles will appear near who you are selecting, and once clicked
	they will no longer be targeted by clones.

-----------------------------------------
		Dimension Hop
-----------------------------------------
D4C has the ability to access alternate dimensions, giving the user
unique access to resources, a quick way to trap opponents, and a
convenient escape if the user is in trouble. D4C's movement between
dimensions requires the user to be between two objects, typically
an american flag.

note: Initially, the Dimension item will need time to set up an
	area for the dimension to exist. This process takes ~ 4 minutes,
	so don't worry if you don't have the item initially- just give
	it some time.


Dimension set Basis: D4C's dimension manifests as a 3x3 chunk area,
	which correlates to an area in the overworld designated by
	the D4C user. Initially, this basis must be set by the user.
	When a basis is ready to be set, you will get a notification
	above your taskbar. Right clicking while holding this item
	will begin creating your dimension, which will be centered
	where you are standing, and will be complete after
	~20 seconds. After you set a basis, you will be able to freely
	enter and exit your dimension.

Entering Dimension: Once a basis is set, right clicking the 'dimension hop'
	ability will cause D4C to lunge in front of you with an american flag.
	for ~4 seconds, D4C will transport anything it touches to your dimension,
	teleporting them to the center. While D4C is in this state, it will
	stand still, allowing the user to walk into it and themselves be transported
	into their dimension. This will not work on the Ender Dragon- they need to
	stay in the End.

	Summoned clones will all stand still when this item is used, and cannot
	be sent to your dimension. Additionally, clones summoned within your dimension will
	always count towards your clone total, meaning the cooldown for the "summon clone"
	item will depend on how many are within your dimension. This means that while
	it is possible to set up a firing squad within your dimension, your ability
	to summon more clones while on the go will be greatly diminished.

Exiting Dimension: Other players who are sent into D4C's dimension will automatically
	leave after a couple seconds. The D4C user, however, may stay inside of their
	dimension for as long as they want. The 'Dimension Hop' item works much the
	same way that it did while not in dimension; however, when something leaves
	D4C's dimension in a certain spot it appears in the correlating spot
	where the dimension's basis was set, instead of the center of the basis.
	For example, if your dimension is centered in the door of a house, and while
	in the dimension you leave near your bed, you will reappear in the overworld
	at your bed.

	This means that you may access your dimension several thousand blocks away
	from where it is based, then exit back at home. This essentially is a form
	of teleportation, which can be used to travel long distances fast, as well
	as escape confrontations.

Re-setting Basis: Setting a basis begins a very long timer. Once this timer is done,
	you will be able to re-set the basis of your dimension to some other location.
	To do this, place the 'Dimension Hop' item into your off-hand. If the timer is done,
	text will apear above your hotbar letting you know that you are able to set a new basis.
	Right clicking while holding this item in your off-hand will cause the "Dimension Hop'
	item to behave the same way it did when initially obtained.

note- You cannot find Corpse Parts in other dimensions- You still need to find 2 devil's palms in order to
	gain Love Train. Nice try though ;).
	

=========================================
		Love Train:
========================================
Love Train is D4C's most powerful ability.
When Love train is active, D4C's user is 
completely invulnerable, has increased mobility,
and has stronger attacks.

In order to Obtain Love Train, you must find two devil's palms, and
collect the corpse parts from them (cannonically you need 13, but
I wouldn't do that to you ;) ). Devil's palms spawn periodically,
but will only appear if you are >1000 blocks away from the nearest
devil's palm. To collect the corpse part, simply walk into
the middle of the palm and stand on the stone block.

After collecting the part, the devil's palm will collapse and become
inactive.

(Note: Superflat worlds, or worlds where the terrain is <20 blocks
high will likely have devil's palms whose bottoms are missing. If you're
in creative mode, you can still collect the corpse part by
flying over to the glowing piece, then flying directly downwards.)

Once you collect 2 corpse parts, you may obtain love train by dropping the 
two parts on the ground next to eachother.

As a sidenote, you may also
turn one of these corpse parts into a "Tusk Corpse Part" by dropping
one corpse part on the ground and two netherite scrap on top of that
(assuming you also have the tusk datapack installed). A Tusk Corpse Part
can be clicked to give you Tusk.

When you obtain Love Train, you will recieve a Love Train item. Love train
is an ability that requires a host, which is something most fighting
games do not acknowledge. Therefore, this ability has 3 settings:

1.Host- Initially, Love Train will require a host. Setting a host
	works the same way that swapping with another clone works.
	Particles will appear in front of you, indicating where you
	are selecting, and mobs will glow when your curser hovers
	over them. Right clicking while a mob is highlighted will
	set them as the "holy host" for Love Train. (hehe)

	Players, clones, and boss mobs may not be chosen as hosts.

	After setting a host, Love train becomes toggleable with no
	cooldown. However, if the host is killed, or if you manually
	unset a mob as host (by Placing Love Train in your off-hand and
	right clicking), love train will have a 1 minute cooldown.
	Though you are invincible while love train is active (with 
	the exception of Tusk act 4 and Gold Experience Requiem's
	'Return To Zero'), the host is not, and other players will
	seek out this host in order to defeat you. You'll want
	to choose a host that will be either easy to hide, or
	has enough health that it will not be able to be killed
	before you can return to defend it.

2.Standby-After setting a host, Love Train is available. You
	can activate this ability by right clicking, and you may turn
	it off by right clicking as well with the Love train
	item selected.

3.Active-When Active, Love Train manifests as a golden wall
	of light. This wall of light will be centered around
	the D4C user, and will point towards wherever the host is.
	
	When active, the user becomes completely immune to damage.
	They gain increased speed and jump power, and water + lava
	will disappear around you when Love Train is active, allowing
	you to part the sea and run along the bottom.

	Love Train has special properties for certain types of mobs.
	Enderman, other players, and hostile mobs will all be knocked
	away if they come into contact with Love Train's wall. This does
	not do any damage, however it is a property that can be used
	to crush mobs in nearby terrain (which does happen to a character
	in canon). 

	Love Train's main ability is to deflect 'bad fortune' (attacks)
	to a random person someone in the world. But, for your sake,
	this love train will deflect damage towards the nearest mob.
	This means that projectiles, like arrows and fireballs, will be
	redirected towards the nearest enemy if they hit Love train. 
	Additionally, most projectiles will become stronger after being deflected.
	This includes revolver shots from Clones, which is a property that
	can be used fully by firing your clones' shots into love train.
	

	Love Train will not send projectiles at your clones, so don't worry
	about that. Clones can still take damage, though. Only the user
	is protected by Love Train.

	As a final note, Creepers and exploding TNT will all be teleported
	away if they come into contact with Love Train, and creepers will
	explode on a random nearby mob. Tusk's projectiles will also
	be teleported away, excluding act 4's main nail shot and the
	infinite rotation. Return to Zero will disable Love Train and
	de-activate it for the duration of RTZ. If caught in a RTZ, you'll
	want to swap to a clone outside of RTZ's range, and run away (lol).


IMPORTANT NOTE: At the time of making this pack,
custom dimensions are not working properly. As
time progresses, I am planning on adding a fourth
ability which will allow the D4C user to enter
a parrallel dimension/send other players to it, but for
now there is a lot of stuff you can do already.
-------------------------------------------------------
		Clones
-------------------------------------------------------
Clones are a feature of this pack that have many uses
outside of pure combat. These uses will allow you to 
automate certain farms, as well as give you access to certain
trades that you could not get in vanilla minecraft.

basic clone commands: When summoned, clones do not initially have any
	special abilities. They will follow the user around,
	and can be made to sit in place by right clicking their feet.
	Again, you can tell if a clone is set to sit in place by holding
	the Clone item, and checking to see if the clone has particles above it.
	Clones Don't like to use portals correctly, so you will not be able
	to go through a nether portal until all clones are made to stay still
	or killed.

Profession: Clones can be given certain items which will give
	them special abilities and trades. If a clone already has a profession,
	they can be given another item, and they will drop their previous item on
	the ground. Clones also drop their item when killed. These items are:

Revolver- Giving clones a revolver will give them a trade
	for gunpowder, as well as a trade for an empty revolver.
	Clones with revolvers will attack nearby hostile mobs within a
	15 - block radius, and will also target mobs marked by
	the user as hostile. 

	Additionally, if the D4C user is within 5 blocks of a clone,
	the clone will fire a round every time the user fires a revolver
	in roughly the same direction like a firing squad. This can be used to hit targets
	at long range, or just to overwhelm another player with the sheer
	number of shots being fired. This property is particularly useful when
	Love Train is active.

Compass- This is one of the most useful clones to have around if you
	do not have love train. When a clone is given a compass, they give
	access to a trade which gives you a book listing all available trades
	that each type of clone will have. Additionally, the "tracker" clone,
	when set to stand still, will face towards the nearest active devil's palm,
	producing green particles in a line facing the direction of the palm.

Pickaxes-Pickaxe clones are probably the most important clone in terms of
	automating farms. Pickaxe clones will break nearby mineable blocks in
	a 3x3x3 cube centered around them, and drop the mined blocks
	at their feet. Clones may be given any tier of pickaxe except netherite,
	and will give trades based on the tier of the pickaxe.

	Information on the pickaxe trades is availible from the compass clones'
	guide book.
	
Axe-Axe clones function similar to Pickaxe clones, but will instead
	automatically mine blocks that a player would typically mine with
	an axe.
	
	Diamond Axe clones sell "Valentine's Brew", and golden axe clones
	sell haste potions to make your own mining easier.

Hoes-	Farmer clones work much the same way as pickaxe clones do, except instead
	of mining blocks in a 3x3x3 radius it will break and re-plant certain crops in a 14x14 area,
	as long as these crops are on the same y-level as the clone. These crops are
	wheat, carrots, potatoes, pumpkins, and watermelon. (you don't need beetroot- it's unhealthy)

	Farmers will also have different trades based off of the tier of tool given,
	except for Netherite, which they do not accept.

Fishing Rod- Fishing villagers will give useful trades for you when you're fishing.


	When you swap with a clone that has a certain profession, you will then have
	whatever profession they have. This does not give you any special properties,
	but it makes sense, and makes it easy to finely position a particular clone
	type. Swapping with a clone that is currently still will not cause
	the clone to become mobile.
----------------------------------------------------
		Tips
----------------------------------------------------
-Love Train is strong against the Ender Dragon, so are clones.
	Setting up several clones near the fountain is a good way
	to deal high damage to the ender dragon when it is landed.

-Another way to deal damage to the ender dragon is to summon a clone 
	in the fountain, tell it to hold position, then swap to
	the clone once the dragon lands. This allows you to get
	close without being hit by the dragon's wings and knocked away.

-Sometimes it is hard to get a clone to stand still. In this case,
	I'd recommend waiting a bit, or simply kill the clone. There
	is no downside to killing clones, as messed up as it is.

-Teleporting long distances while a clone is not on hold position can
	cause the clone to be left in unloaded chunks, which traps you
	in whichever dimension you are in currently. I'd recommend
	not teleporting while there are clone that aren't on hold position.
	
	If you do teleport and unload a moving clone's chunk, you can fix this problem
	simply by going back to wherever you left the clone.

-Technically, you cannot swim while love train is active, but water tends to
	refill behind you as you run along the sea floor. This is useful as an escape
	mechanism, or to traverse the Nether. But, you want to be careful at home
	if you have some smaller water source nearby.

-A good host for love train is something that has a lot of health, like an iron golem.
	Hosts have a small amount of extra resistance, but also become immobile.
	Love Train has no range limit, so it isn't a terrible idea to make some secure
	place for your host far away from wherever you anticipate fighting someone.
	
-Small hosts can also be a good idea, but the host particles will likely give them away.

-you can make tnt a host, but that's stupid so don't lol.

============================================================
In the future, I plan on adding a custom dimension to
this pack once that feature of datapacks is made workable again.
Until then, feel free to leave feedback on the planetminecraft page
as well as on my youtube channel. 

If you have any questions on the pack, you can watch the youtube
video, or leave a comment if you still aren't sure about some aspect.


Thanks for reading all of this, have a good day :)
