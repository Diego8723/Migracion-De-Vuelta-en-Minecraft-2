==============Background===============================
=======================================================
	Whitesnake is the stand of Enrico Pucci, a priest
who was corrupted by Dio. From Dio, Pucci learned of
something called 'Heaven', but not in the traditional sense;
To Pucci, heaven was being able to know your fate, and live
peacefully with this knowledge. 
	The process of attaining 'Heaven' led Pucci to obtain 
many stands; However, Whitesnake was the stand he originally
recieved from the arrow. Whitesnake's ability is to steal
parts of other's souls in the form of CDs, disks. While simple,
this ability is incredibly powerful. It allows pucci to take
senses, memories, and most importantly, stands. 

===================================================
=============Usage=================================
===================================================
In order to obtain Whitesnake, you need to first craft
a Stand Arrow. To do this, drop a Nether Star on the ground, then
drop a Spectral Arrow on top of that. Be careful not to shoot
this arrow, since it won't be recoverable. 

Once you have the stand arrow, drop it on the ground, followed by black dye
. You will then have Whitesnake, and recieve 3 items:

1)Whitesnake- This miniature version of whitesnake is what you use to summon
	your stand. Placing this item in the far right slot of your hotbar 
	will summon Whitesnake. Placing it into your off-hand (I like to use 'f' to swap them)
	will de-summon your stand.

	Right-clicking this item will allow you to 'silence' your stand. Silencing your stand
	will prevent stand items from being placed back into your inventory after you drop them,
	which can be useful to save inventory space. Additionally, right-clicking your stand item
	while silenced will replace all of your items. Item's for Whitesnake are not automatically
	replaced every time you drop or otherwise remove them from your inventory, so it is possible
	to simply remove all of whitesnakes item's from your inventory while not silenced.

2)Punch / Disc- This item is whitesnake's main ability. Right clicking this item while holding
	it in your main-hand will cause whitesnake to punch. This punch does a low amount of damage,
	but does knock mobs away. 

	Right clicking this item while it is in your off-hand (make sure you don't have any
	tools in your main-hand) will cause Whitesnake to steal a disc from mobs and even players
	in front of you. The type of disc you recieve depends on the type of mob you take it from.
	Particles will appear above mobs nearby to indicate the type of disc they will give you.
	
	When mobs get disc'd, they lose their 'souls', and remain dormant until they recieve another
	disc of either their type or another type.

3)Remote control- Holding right click with this item in your main-hand will cause Whitesnake
	to fly in the direction you are facing. Whitesnake's punch, disc, as well as it's acid ability
	can all be used remotely.

	Placing this item in your off-hand will return Whitesnake back to you. If whitesnake goes too
	far, it will automatically return as well.


===================================================
=============Discs=================================
===================================================
	This section will detail the kinds of discs you can get
and what they do. Discs are their own items which can be used by any player.
Most discs are thrown, meaning you can disc things at range (though this
feature is a tad bit glitchy- I'd recommend discing things at close range
to be safe). However, some discs are instant-effect, and will be used by
the player.

Water Disc- This disc is obtained by mobs that are aquatic. Placing
	this disc into another mob will cause them to believe they
	are aquatic. Mobs under this effect will take damage unless they
	submerge themselves in water.

Passive Mob Disc- This disc is taken from mobs that don't typically
	attack players, like cows. Hostile mobs hit by the passive mob
	disc will become 'pacified', and no longer seek to kill players
	and/or villagers.

	Players hit by the passive mob disc will lose the ability to 
	seriously harm other creatures.

	Passive mob discs may even be used to un-steal villagers,
	though they won't get their original trades back.

Hostile Mob Disc- This disc comes from mobs that are hostile. Placing
	this disc into a passive mob will cause them to attack players
	and villagers, however mobs made hostile by whitesnake will NOT
	attack the whitesnake user.

	As per usual, if a hostile mob that has had it's disc stolen
	is hit with a hostile mob disc, it will return to normal.

Creeper Disc- Mobs hit by the creeper disc will take on the properties
	of creepers and explode if players get too close. It doesn't
	make a lot of sense, but Pucci made a frog explode for no reason
	in the show, so I figured this is a smaller leap in logic than that scene.

Acid Disc- Acid discs can be obtained by discing a slime. These discs give
	Whitesnake the ability to, upon use, release a cloud of acid which poisons
	and slows all mobs and players nearby. This ability is particularly useful
	when remote-controlling whitesnake, as it has a broad hitbox, and prevents
	targets from escaping.

Vision Disc- Vision discs are stolen from players. When a player is disced, they lose
	their sight temporarily. If they are not a stand user, the story ends here. But...

Stand Disc-Players who are stand users AND who have had their vision stolen with become
	vulnerable to having their stand stolen for a short window. If whitesnake
	successfully discs a blinded player, their stand will be turned into a disc. However,
	unlike other discs, this one will be given to the player who had their stand stolen rather
	than the whitesnake user themself. What this means is that in order to actually steal
	another player's stand, Whitesnake must not only steal their stand disc, but also
	kill them so that they drop it (or simply ask politely IDK). Stealing stands is an
	incredibly powerful ability, so I wanted to make sure that it was balanced in some way.
	I think this is a fair middle-ground.

Villager disc- The final and potentially most useful disc is the villager disc. 
	When you Disc a villager, you will recieve a disc containing all of their trades.
	This disc may then be used on any other villager, essentially allowing you to
	bring your favorite trades wherever you go!

	Just make sure to keep track of which villager's disc is which. It is important
	to supply your villagers with the correct workstations- even disked villagers-
	because they may otherwise lose their profession.

	Also, Villager discs are dropped at the feet of villagers instead of automatically
	give to the WS user. 
	

That's all, hope you enjoy the datapack. 
Give it a diamond and all that, and have a good day ;).
