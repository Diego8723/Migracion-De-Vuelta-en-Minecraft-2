Silver Chariot is the stand of Jean Pierre Polnareff.
It's ability is kind of basic: It has a sword and is
fast. Additionally, Silver Chariot may remove it's
armor to gain even more speed, and can even shoot
the blade of it's foil at an enemy if the user is in
trouble. 

Silver Chariot does, however, gain a new set of abilities
many years after it's introduction in the form of
Chariot Requiem. Chariot Requiem's abilities are
ill-defined within the source material, however it
appears able to manipulate souls, and by extension stands.
It is a very dangerous stand, however it's potential
is never truly realized, as it's user does not
control it. 

In this datapack, however, you will get the 
opportunity to control Chariot Requiem- that is,
if you can get it under control first.

To unlock Silver Chariot, you first need a stand arrow.
To 'craft' a stand arrow, throw a Nether star on
the ground with a spectral arrow. The nearest player will
then recieve a 'stand arrow'. 

Afterwards, you must throw the stand arrow onto the ground,
and then throw an iron ingot onto that. You will then
unlock Silver Chariot forever, and recieve 4 items:
1)A miniature Silver Chariot
2)An Item labeled "strike"
3)Another Item labeled "Armor"
3)And an Item labeled "Eject Blade/Deflect"

####Note: The game will give you these items back if you
	drop them or Die.

Mini SC: This item is used to summon your stand. Simply
	Place it into your 9th inventory slot (the furthest
	slot to the right on your hotbar) to summon Silver Chariot.
	To De-summon, place this item into your off-hand.

Strike: This item controls all of the basic sword attacks of Chariot.
	If you click with this item, Chariot will go in front of
	you and, after a short delay, stab with it's sword.
	The hitboxes for most of SC's moves are smaller than
	other stands such as Gold Experience, so you have to 
	be precise with your aim. If this move hits, Chariot
	will impale the target, and hold them on it's sword
	for a couple seconds.

	Putting this item into your off hand will cause Chariot 
	to do a barrage, constantly damaging your opponent.
	The hitbox of this move is small as well, however it can
	be used directly after impaling an opponent. Using
	Chariot's barrage does not cancel the impaled effect,
	and the impaled target will be held in place for your 
	barrage. 

		I like to use 'f' to swap my main and offhand
	items quickly.

Eject Blade/Deflect: 
		This item has two distinct uses. Clicking with this
	item in hand will cause SC to stand in front of the user, then 
	launch it's blade. This ejected blade does a large amount of
	damage, however using it is slow and will disable the rest of Chariot's
	abilities until the user retrieves the ejected blade.

		Putting this item in your off-hand will cause Chariot
	to stand in front of the user and swing it's sword in a circle,
	deflecting all projeciles it hits, inluding fireballs, arrows,
	snowballs, etc.. Deflected projectiles will
	be sent in the direction the user is looking, though it is
	not exact. This move will not deflect projectiles which are
	aimed at the user's back.

Armor:	This Item is rather simple. Clicking with this item in hand
	will cause Silver Chariot to remove it's armor. With it's armor
	removed, Silver chariot becomes faster, but sacrifices health.

	Without it's armor, the user's max health will drop, however
	they will gain 1.5x movement speed. Additionally, Chariot's
	moves will trigger faster, and it's barrage will do more damage.
	
	In order to put it's armor back on, just put the Armor item into
	your off-hand.

============Chariot Requiem=================
============================================
In order to unlock Chariot Requiem, you must
craft another arrow. Unlike Gold Experience Requiem,
you will actually get to keep the arrow after using it.
After crafting another stand arrow, throw it on the ground, and 
move Silver Chariot onto it. Once you do this,
you initiate the Chariot Requiem boss fight.

Since the Chariot Requiem fight is supposed to 
be disorienting, I'll wait until the bottom
of this document to explain each stage. 

Once you defeat Chariot, you will be
able to control Chariot Requiem yourself. Once
you do this, you will gain 4 new items:

1)Chariot Aura

2)Control Stand

3)Swap Body

4)Chariot Requiem

At this point, you may discard the remove armor item,
silver chariot item, and eject blade item, as 
they no longer do anything. 

"Strike", however, still
retains it's pre-requiem function. Clicking will
cause Chariot to impale a target in front of the user,
and placing this item in your off-hand will cause
Chariot to do a barrage. Chariot Requiem does
slightly more damage than Silver Chariot.

The "Chariot Requiem" item replaces the "Silver Chariot"
item, and is used to summon and de-summon your stand.

New items:

1)Chariot Aura
	Clicking this item will toggle Chariot
Requiem's sleep aura. When this aura is active,
shadows will appear by nearby mobs, and they
will begin to sleep. Additionally, a shadow
will appear behind Chariot itself. Clicking this item
again will turn the aura off. This aura is necessary
for some of Chariot's other abilities. It should be
noted, however, that it does not effect players.

	Placing "Chariot Aura" into your
off-hand will cause nearby players to be randomly put into nearby
mobs. This is an effective way to ward players away,
however if the enemy player is already possessing a mob
they will not be teleported away. When the mob an enemy
player is possessing dies, they will return to being
normal players, and will not die themselves.

2)Become Stand
	This item is pretty straightforwards. Clicking
with this item in your hand will cause you to become
chariot requiem. While you are chariot requiem, you gain
additional defence at the cost of speed. While you are
Chariot, you can still use "Strike" and "Chariot Aura", however
un-summoning your stand and Body Swap are disabled. You
also will be invisible to mobs if you do not wear armor.
	If you are having trouble using items while
controlling Chariot Requiem, try walking forwards and using them.
Minecraft doesn't like it when you use items while inside of 
entities.

3)Swap Body
	This item allows the Chariot Requiem user to
possess nearby mobs that have been put to sleep by
chariot's aura. When this item is held, a marker
will appear in front of the user. The mob that is nearest
to this marker will begin to glow, and if the user clicks
they will move into the selected mob. Certain mobs have
special characteristics, most notably bats, which will
fly if you look upwards. 
	If the Chariot user is low health, this ability can be used to 
quickly escape and heal. The Chariot user will gain health
every time they use this ability, however there is a major-risk
that the possessed mob dies. If the body you possess dies, you
also die. Therefore, you want to be careful with low-hp mobs
like bats or small slimes, as well as undead mobs which burn in the sun.
	Placing the swap body item into your off-hand
will cause the user to return to their normal body, however
there is a 20-second cooldown after you possess a mob. This gives
other players the opportunity to kill the mob you inhabit before
you can escape.

=============================================
==============Chariot Requiem================
===============Boss Fight====================
=============================================
	The Chariot Requiem fight begins the
moment silver chariot touches the stand arrow.
You can do this by using "strike" or by using
the deflect projectile ability. 

Phase 1)
	When the fight begins, everyone on the
server will be teleported into a random mob roughly
50 blocks away from chariot. The first thing 
they must do is find Chariot, which, depending
on which mob you are put into, can be very difficult.
	Chariot also puts mobs to sleep, meaning
that most hostile mobs will be dormant for the duration of the fight.
It is actually not a bad idea to initiate the fight at night, as
more mobs on the surface of the world increases the
probability that you will not be put into a mob within
a cave. Phase 1 ends once Chariot takes damage.
	Chariot Requiem also disables the use of stands 
nearby, other than Gold Experience Requiem.

Phase 2) 
	After taking a little damage, Chariot Requiem will
drop it's arrow, which will glow brightly. Chariot will
attack any player who picks up this arrow, and will not
take any damage during phase 2. The only way to end this phase
is to give Chariot it's arrow back. Sometimes, Chariot will
pick it up on it's own.
	This stand arrow is a functional stand-arrow, and
can be used to get a stand if you want to. This will, however,
leave Chariot Requiem 

Phase 3)
	Phase 3 is similar to PHase 1. Chariot will
wander arround, and will not attack anyone who does not attack
it first. However, this time Chariot will have Gold Experience,
which will server as a bodygard, and attack nearby players periodically.
This stage is best handled by using ranged weapons, or by attacking
Chariot when Gold Experience has already attacked recently. Bringing
Chariot down to roughly one-half of it's total health will bring
it into stage 4.

Stage 4)
	Same thing as stage 2.

Stage 5)
	The final stage of the Chariot requiem fight.
Once in stage 5, Chariot requiem will place the players back
into their original bodies. Additionally, a shadow
will appear behind Chariot.
	If players approach Chariot Requiem during this stage,
two things will happen:

1)nearby mobs that are put asleep by chariot will, one by one,
get angry at players that approach Chariot and attack them.

2)A soul-fire orb will appear behind the nearby player.

For the first half of this stage, Chariot takes damage the
same way it always does- by attacking it directly. However,
once Chariot gets to roughly 30 hp, it will no longer take damage.

	Canonically, the reason Chariot's shadow always appears
on the opposite side of the observer is because it is the shadow
of one's own soul. In order to create this shadow, an orb of
light appears behind the nearby person. Attacking this orb does
damage to Chariot, however, can be fatal, as attacking the orb
attacks your own soul.

	Therefore, in order to finally defeat Chariot, you
must attack the light orb which appears behind you when nearby
Chariot. This is particularly hard to do, especially if Chariot
is angry at you, and if you do not have armor on it can kill you.
Using a stronger weapon will do more damage to Chariot, however
all attacks reflect the same amount of damage. Once Chariot is
at 0 hp, you win, stands are re-enabled, and the Silver chariot 
user will be able to use Chariot Requiem.
