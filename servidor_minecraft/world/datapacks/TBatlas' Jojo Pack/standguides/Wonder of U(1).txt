=================Background=========================
====================================================
	"Wonder of U" is the stand of Tooru from
Jojo's Bizzare Adventure part 8, Jojolion. 
	Wonder of U usually takes the form of an elderly
rock human, and takes on the persona of "Akefu Sotoru", head doctor
of TG University Hospital. The true Akefu Sotoru died years ago,
and 'Wonder of U' assumes his identity. His appearance seems to be that
of a rock human, a separate 'species' of human that is silicon
based instead of carbon based. Wonder of U appears to have
a very long range, and can be controlled remotely from across
the entire town of Morioh.

	From what we've seen in the manga so far, The Wonder
Of U appears to have 2 main abilities.

1)Appearance change: Wonder of U can change its appearance
	from it's normal, robotic look to that of Akefu Stotoru.
	When The Wonder of U is in this form, it can be seen
	by non-stand users.

2)Calamity: This ability is activated whenever someone even has
	the intent of "pursueing" the head doctor. When "calamity"
	is activated, the pursuers will begin to be hit by a wave of bad
	luck, bumping into objects and being severely injured by even 
	small objects like rain drops. This ability also takes the form
	of a manifestation of the Head doctor appearing near those affected
	by 'calamity'. If someone does not have the intent to
	pursue the head doctor/has not been marked personally by Tooru,
	they will not be able to see these apparitions of the head doctor,
	but may be 'caught up' in the calamity, and hurt.
		The ability also appears to do damage based on your 'karma'.

====================================================
In order to obtain 'Wonder of U', you need to first craft
a Stand Arrow. To do this, drop a Nether Star on the ground, then
drop a Spectral Arrow on top of that. Be careful not to shoot
this arrow, since it won't be recoverable. 

Once you have the stand arrow, drop it on the ground, followed by an 
Ender Pearl. You will then have 'the wonder of u', and recieve 4 items:

1) 'Wonder of U'. Putting this item in your 9th inventory slot
(the one furthest to the right in your hotbar) will summon your stand.
To un-summon it, place this item into your off-hand. Clicking this item
will Silence your stand. Silenced stands will have ability items turned off,
allowing the user to free up inventory space.

2)'Control Stand'. Clicking this item will swap you and your stand,
replacing you with a model of tooru (I've uploaded the skin
to planetminecraft if you want it to match). You will then become your
stand, and be able to control it freely. Clicking again will put you back 
to where you used the ability originally. You can go as far away as you
want with this stand, and additionally you can use this to transfer
items between yourself and your stand location. 
	Placing this item into your off-hand will cause your stand
to return to you. You may also use other items while controlling your
stand directly.

Note:if "tooru" is hit by any other player while the user
	is remote controlling WOU, they will automatically
	be brought back.

3)'Change stand form'. Clicking this item will cause your stand
to cycle through each of wonder of U's 3 forms. Each 
form has a different ability(These are explained in the next
 item description) These 3 forms are:
	1)Pure Stand
	2)Stand/Head Doctor
	3)Head Doctor

4)'Punch/Become Immaterial/Crazy Train'. This item does different
things depending on which form your stand is in.

a)Pure Stand- In WOU's base form, it functions similar to other stands.
	While WOU was never canonically seen using physical attacks
	against it's enemies, we can assume that the two massive
	blades on each of it's arms would likely hurt if they hit
	you. 

	Clicking with this item will cause WOU to do a quick slash
	in front of the user.

	Placing this item in your off-hand will cause WOU to
	move in front of you and barrage. It is not particularly
	powerful.

b)Half Stand half doctor- In this form, WOU's ability puts you into
	spectator mode for a limited time, alowing you
	to pass through solid objects. In order to use this ability, 
	you must be controlling your stand. Very useful for getting around.

	If you are not controlling your stand, this ability will allow
	the user to trigger calamities to nearby mobs. More details on
	that in the "Head Doctor" section.

c) Head Doctor- 'Calamity'. This ability will mark any mob or player within a
	small radius around the player for 'calamity'. Upon using this ability,
	an apparition of the Head doctor will appear near the effected player, moving
	slowly. If the effected players/mobs attempt to 'pursue' either these apparitions
	or the Stand itself, they will be met with the effects of calamity, which will become
	more intense if the pursuer gets closer to the head doctor.

	These include:
		-nearby hostile mobs becoming stronger and doing more damage
		-boats and minecarts bumping into the player, doing damage
		-rain doing damage, and lightning striking the player if they get too close
		-falling blocks and projectiles being drawn to the player
		-tnt minecarts exploding
		-Items and projectiles flying at the player to do damage (if toggled on)

	Additionally, hostile mobs that are near the User in this form will become weaker, and
	creepers will 'misfire', doing no damage. 

	There are also special cases for the ender dragon and wither. The
	Wither will draw in creepers and cause them to explode, doing significant damage.
	The Ender dragon will draw in tnt-minecarts, which will explode and do damage,
	but not a lot. You can use this stand to kill the Ender Dragon, but it will
	not necessarily be easy. It is mostly meant to deter other players.

	In order to stop these effects, crouch and right click the Calamity
	Item. This will remove calamity effects from the nearest calamity
	effected entity. 

	Placing this item in your off-hand allows the user to toggle
	Item Calamity. When this option is on, items near enemies will
	fly at them and do great damage, especially if they are near the
	WOU user. This will also effect projectiles. This option
	is toggleable, as keeping it on causes arrows/eggs to not
	function normally, and I figured that you might want to be
	able to use those items sometimes :P.


Also, putting 24 Gold ingots in the top left inventory slot, 2 poppies in the slot to the right,
a diamond axe one more slot to the right, controlling your stand, and crouching will be neat
so do it :P.
