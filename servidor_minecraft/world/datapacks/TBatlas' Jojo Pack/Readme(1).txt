========================
====Introduction========
========================
TBatlas' Jojopack began as a collection of individual
stands, which all had their own packs and features. Stands
are the main power system in the hit series "Jojo's Bizzarre Adventure".
Stands are the manifestation of their users unique fighting spirit,
and give their users special abilities. 

This datapack features a variety of different stands from Jojo, as well as some 
useful items. Initially, all of these packs were their own separate entities, meant
to be stand-alone add ons to a typical minecraft world. However, as the number of stands
began to rise, so too did the amount of interactions between stands. It became apparent that
it was necessary to consolidate all of the previous packs into one big project. This helps
me personally stay organized, but it also ensures that as updates roll out that you, the player,
will have up-to-date stands as new features arise. 

============================
======general usage=========
============================
Each stand has it's own quirks, and if you want to learn more about them I'd
suggest either watching the YouTube videos on them or reading their file
in the "stand guides" folder. This section will simply go over some core
features that you'll probably need to use regardless of the stand you
are trying to obtain. Only one person may have a given stand per server,
and you may only have one stand at a time.

This pack requires a resourcepack, which can be found here:
https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/tbatlas-jojo-pack/

=============================
======arrows=================
=============================
Most stands are going to be gained by using arrows. To craft a stand arrow
Simply throw:
 1) a spectral arrow
 2) a nether star or netherite ingot

on the ground. If these two items contact eachother, it will create a stand
arrow. From here, you will need to obtain an item specific to your desired
stand. 

WARNING! THE STAND ARROW IS AN ACTUAL ARROW! MAKE SURE NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY
FIRE IT FROM A CROSSBOW OR SOMETHING, AS THIS WILL WASTE THE ARROW!
(unless you're just trying to flex, in which case go ahead and waste all of your netherstars lol)

For example, Gold Experience requires a gold ingot. Once you have
both a stand arrow and a gold ingot, you throw them on the ground in the same fashion as
you did to craft the stand arrow, and voila; you now have Gold Experience!

The items necessary to each stand are listed in their files, but a quick list;

Gold Experience -> Gold Ingot
Silver Chariot  -> Iron Ingot
Wonder of U     -> Ender Pearl
D4C             -> lapis lazuli
Whitesnake	-> Black Dye
Crazy Diamond   -> diamond

The only stand which cannot be obtained using an arrow is Tusk.
Tusk uses a Corpse Part, and details on how to obtain one are present
in Tusk's file.

========================================
===========Stand Controls===============
========================================

Stand abilities and controls will depend ultimately
on the stand you are using. However, there are some controls
which apply to all stands.

Upon obtaining a stand, several items will be added to your inventory.
One of these items will be a miniature model of the stand itself. This item
is used to summon your stand by placing it in the far right inventory slot on
your hotbar.

To de-summon your stand, place the stand item into your off-hand.

Some stands also include a "silence" feature, which will prevent stand-related 
items from being replaced and cluttering your inventory. This can be activated by
right-clicking the stand item.

Stand items may have uses involving right clicking, placing them in your off-hand,
right clicking while they're in your off-hand, right clicking while crouching, etc..
The full details for each stand's controls are provided in their associated file in the
standguides folder.

Important Note: The pack will try to replace lost stand items if it notices they are missing
from your inventory. Minecraft thinks that an item has left your inventory when you
left click it when your inventory GUI is open. This will cause your items to duplicate.
To get around this, simply drop one of the duplicates, as they will be destroyed automatically.
Personally, I like to use "F" to automatically swap my mainhand and offhand. This prevents the item
from duplicating, and makes it quick and easy to summon/de-summon your stand.

====================================
===========Pucci====================
====================================
Pucci is an NPC who, unlike in the anime, will be helpful to you.
In order to summon pucci, you need to make a written book. You may
write whatever you want in the book. You must then publish the book,
and name it "Bible" (With a capital 'B'). Reading this Bible will
summon Pucci. Once he appears, he'll have a little speech to give. Once
he's done, you'll be able to use him to remove your stand, and store it
as a disc!

When you are close to Pucci, he will ask you if you want your stand
disced. In order to do this, simply open your 'Bible' back up, and he
will Disc your stand and return it to you.

If you not close to Pucci, then using the Bible will allow you to move
him wherever you'd like. Maybe you build him a house, or a church or something.
Idk, go crazy.

====================================
============Upgrades================
====================================

Some stands will have 'evolved forms' that can be accessed in a number of ways. 
For Tusk, it has acts which may be unlocked by completing specific tasks. For D4C, it involves
finding 2 corpse parts, and for GE and SC it involves piercing your stand with an arrow.

In all cases, once these upgrades are unlocked, they are unlocked permenately, even if you
remove your stand. Additionally, requiem carries over from GE to SC and Visa Versa, so you
won't need 2 stand arrows every time you want to access their evolved forms. 

=====================================
===========Useful Commands===========
=====================================
Currently this pack is incomplete, so this last section is meant to give you all
the ability to access the full range of content until I implement some important features.

"/function pack:removestand"
>This command will remove your current stand.

"/scoreboard players set @s req 0"
>This command will un-req your stand. Could be used if you wish to
do the SCR boss fight again. Changing 0->1 will turn your stand into
it's requiem form (if it has one)

"/function pack:tuskfunctions/bless"
>Tusk can only be obtained through the "Tusk Holy Corpse" item, which
is typically obtained through crafting. I'm not a good coder, so for some
reason it only lets you craft the corpse part once. Using this function
while standless will give you Tusk. It will also give you tusk if you
already have a stand, so make sure you're standless, and that no one else
on the server has Tusk when you use it.

====================================
========Conclusion==================
====================================
If you have any questions, you can leave a comment, but it's always a good idea to check
the YouTube videos (I'm TBatlas on YouTube as well) and original Datapack pages. It's not 
impossible that someone else also had your same question and (hopefully) had it answered.

Thanks guys, and I hope you enjoy the pack :)
